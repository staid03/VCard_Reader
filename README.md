# VCard_Reader
Written in AutoHotKey to extract details from a single VCard (V-Card) and manually sort through each contact to keep their details or not.

Input file: 
> Contacts.vcf

Two output files created: 
> Contacts_list_Keep_%aTime%.vcf, and 
> Contacts_list_Reject_%aTime%.vcf

Known problems:
<br>1) Not the greatest interface but more than sufficient for what I wanted - a one-off job to separate VCards into a list of Keep or Reject.
